1. Open the given .pcap file in Wireshark.

2. In the Wireshark display filter bar, apply a filter to focus on relevant traffic:
   http || tcp

3. Go through the captured packets and inspect the HTTP requests and responses:
   - Look for suspicious or unusual data in the HTTP payload.
   - You may find a long random-looking string that appears to be Base64 encoded.

4. Once you identify the suspected flag string:
   - Right-click the packet and choose “Follow” → “TCP Stream” or “HTTP Stream” if needed, to see the full data.
   - Copy the Base64 string (it will typically look like random letters, numbers, +, /, and =).

5. Decode the Base64 string to retrieve the flag:
   - Using a terminal:
     echo "BASE64_STRING_HERE" | base64 -d
   - Or use any online/offline Base64 decoder.

6. The decoded output will be in the format of the flag for this challenge.
   That decoded text is the final flag.
